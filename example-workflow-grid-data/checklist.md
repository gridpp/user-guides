# Using Grid-based data in your workflow - Checklist

* I can successfully modify the Grid workflow example to:
  * use an input `DiracFile` to with an lfn corresponding to data I have uploaded to the Grid;
  * write the output data to my user area on the DFC.
* I can set the output LFN base in my Ganga configuration file;
* I can run the modified Grid workflow example and retrieve the output from the Grid.
