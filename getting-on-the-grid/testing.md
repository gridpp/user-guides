#Getting on the Grid - Testing

##Your grid certificate

* **Viewing your certificate details**: visit
[this website](https://portal.ca.grid-support.ac.uk/caportal/cert_owner)
with the broswer in which your certificate is installed.
You should see your grid certificate details displayed.

##Joining a Virtual Organisation

* **Joining the GridPP VO**: Click
[here](https://voms.gridpp.ac.uk:8443/voms/gridpp/user/search.action).
If your request has been approved and confirmed, you should be listed
as a VO member.
* **Joining a Regional VO**: Click on
[`vo.londongrid.ac.uk`](https://voms.gridpp.ac.uk:8443/voms/vo.londongrid.ac.uk/user/search.action),
[`vo.northgrid.ac.uk`](https://voms.gridpp.ac.uk:8443/voms/vo.northgrid.ac.uk/user/search.action),

##First steps with DIRAC

* **Accessing the GridPP DIRAC server**: access https://dirac.gridpp.ac.uk with your browser.
If your grid certificate has been successfully installed in your browser,
you should be asked to identify yourself with the certificate in question.
You will then see the GridPP DIRAC server homepage.
Check the bottom right-hand corner - if you can only see _Visitor_
and **not** your username and DN,
something has gone wrong and you are not (or rather, your certificate is not) not registered
with the GridPP DIRAC server.
* **Joining the GridPP DIRAC mailing list**: once you have
_subscribed_ and have _been approved_,
you should be able to view the
[subscribers list](https://mailman.ic.ac.uk/mailman/roster/gridpp-dirac-users)
from the
[list homepage](https://mailman.ic.ac.uk/mailman/listinfo/gridpp-dirac-users)
and confirm that you are indeed on it.
