#Getting on the Grid
We have run local jobs so far.
Now it's time to get on the grid - after which, we will be able to
configure Ganga to submit our jobs to the GridPP DIRAC system
and so access all of the computing and data resources
GridPP has to offer.
The following sections will cover:

* [Getting a grid certificate](grid-certificate.md);
* [Joining a Virtual Organisation](joining-a-vo.md);
* [Logging on to GridPP DIRAC](dirac-first-steps.md).

We'll find out more about what each of these steps
mean and entail as we go.

Some of these steps require interaction with a human being.
For example, to get a grid certificate you have to visit
your local Registration Authority in person with
photographic ID.
Please bear this in mind before you begin -
it is not an automated
process and may take a little time.
It will be worth it though!

Let's start by getting you a
[grid certificate](grid-certificate.html),
shall we?
