#Getting on the Grid
We have only worked locally on our GridPP CernVM so far.
Now it's time to get on the grid.
The following sections will cover:

* [Getting a grid certificate](grid-certificate.md);
* [Joining a Virtual Organisation](joining-a-vo.md);
* [Logging on to GridPP DIRAC](dirac-first-steps.md).

We'll find out more about what each of these steps
mean and entail as we go.

Some of these steps require interaction with a human being.
For example, to get a grid certificate you have to visit
your local Registration Authority in person with
photographic ID.
Please bear this in mind before you begin - unlike
setting up a GridPP CernVM, it is not an automated
process and may take a little time.
It will be worth it though!

Let's start by getting you a
[grid certificate](grid-certificate.html),
shall we?
