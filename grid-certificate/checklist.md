#Your grid certificate - checklist

* I have requested a grid certificate from the
[UK Certificate Authority](http://ngs.ac.uk/ukca) (UKCA).
* I know where my nearest
[Registration Authority](https://portal.ca.grid-support.ac.uk/caportal/pub/viewralist) (RA) is.
* I have visited my nearest RA and confirmed my identity.
* I have downloaded my grid certificate .p12 file and installed it in my browser.
* I have backed up my grid certificate .p12 file in a secure location.
