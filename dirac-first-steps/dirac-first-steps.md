#First steps with DIRAC

There are many ways of accessing and using grid resources.
Larger organisations - such as the four LHC experiments - 
have developed their own frameworks, architectures and mechanisms
to enable their members to run jobs and access experimental data.

One such framework - DIRAC - is used by LHCb, but also
many other grid projects, to manage grid jobs and storage.
You can read more about
DIRAC (Distributed Infrastructure with Remote Agent Control)
<a href="http://diracgrid.org/" target="_blank">here</a>,
but for our purposes all you need to know for now is that
DIRAC provides a way for you to access grid resources
without worrying too much about what's going on
behind the scenes.

##The GridPP DIRAC instance

The Imperial College London GridPP Resource Centre (RC) hosts an
instance of DIRAC on behalf of GridPP.
The Imperial DIRAC instance is is capable of serving multiple VOs,
providing grid job and data management capabilities for smaller,
non-LHC user communities wishing to make use of GridPP resources.
As a new user, you can register to use the GridPP DIRAC instance
as a member of the `gridpp` VO or one of the Regional VOs.
This will allow you to test out various bits of grid functionality
to determine if grid computing will meet your needs and the needs
of your users.

To register, simply email the
<a href="mailto:lcg-site-admin@imperial.ac.uk" target="_blank">GridPP DIRAC Support Team</a>
with your grid certificate DN
(you can find this out
<a href="https://portal.ca.grid-support.ac.uk/caportal/cert_owner" target="_blank">this website</a>here</a>)
and the VOs you wish to use with the GridPP DIRAC instance.
