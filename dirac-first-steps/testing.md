#First steps with DIRAC - testing

* **Accessing the GridPP DIRAC server**: access https://dirac.gridpp.ac.uk with your browser.
If your grid certificate has been successfully installed in your browser,
you should be asked to identify yourself with the certificate in question.
You will then see the GridPP DIRAC server homepage.
Check the bottom right-hand corner - if you can only see _Visitor_
and **not** your username and DN,
you are not (or rather, your certificate is not) not registered
with the GridPP DIRAC server.
Please contact the [GridPP DIRAC support team](mailto:lcg-site-admin@imperial.ac.uk).
Note that there may be a delay of a couple of hours (< 24) after
joining a VO before you are recognised by the GridPP DIRAC server.
* **Joining the GridPP DIRAC mailing list**: once you have
_**subscribed**_ and have _**been approved**_,
you should be able to view the
<a href="https://mailman.ic.ac.uk/mailman/roster/gridpp-dirac-users" target="_blank">subscribers list</a>
from the <a href="https://mailman.ic.ac.uk/mailman/listinfo/gridpp-dirac-users" target="_blank">list homepage</a>
and confirm that you are indeed on it.
