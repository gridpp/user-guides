#Joining a Virtual Organisation

Your grid certificate identifies you to the grid as an individual user,
but it's not enough on its own to allow you to use grid resources;
you also need to join a Virtual Organisation (VO).
These are essentially just user groups - typically one per experiment -
and individual Resource Centres (RCs) can choose to support
work by users of a particular VO.
Most RCs support the four VOs associated with the
Large Hadron Collider (LHC) experiments.
The sign-up procedure varies from VO to VO.
UK-based VOs typically require a manual approval step,
while LHC VOs require an active <a href="http://cern.ch" target="_blank">CERN</a>
account. If you are already part of an experiment that is
represented by a VO, they should provide you with any specific
instructions you need to join.

If you're interesting in using the grid but are not (yet) working as part of
a user community already represented by a VO, worry not.
GridPP have created a catch-all VO - <a href="https://voms.gridpp.ac.uk:8443/voms/gridpp/" target="_blank">`gridpp`</a> - and four
Regional Virtual Organisations (RVOs) corresponding to the
four Tier 2s that can be joined to test out what the grid has to offer.

##Joining the GridPP VO

To join the <a href="https://voms.gridpp.ac.uk:8443/voms/gridpp/" target="_blank">`gridpp`</a> VO, access
<a href="https://voms.gridpp.ac.uk:8443/voms/gridpp/register/start.action" target="_blank">this page</a>
using a browser that has your grid certificate installed
and follow the instructions.

##Joining a Regional VO
Likewise, you can join one of the four regional VOs by clicking
on the links in the table below 
and following the instructions.

Once you have joined a VO, congratulations - you are ready to start
using the grid!
