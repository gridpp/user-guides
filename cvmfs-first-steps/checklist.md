#A Taste of the Grid: the CernVM-FS - Checklist

* I have looked at the contents of the
[CERN@school](https://cernatschool.web.cern.ch)
CVMFS repository using the `ls` command.
* I have tried running the
`process-frames.py`
Python script from the
[CERN@school](https://cernatschool.web.cern.ch)
CVMFS repository and watched it fail
when the system is unable to
find the `pylab` Python module.
* I have set my `PYTHONPATH` environment variable
to include the Python libraries needed for the
[CERN@school](https://cernatschool.web.cern.ch)
analysis code.
* I have successfully run the 
`process-frames.py`
Python script from the
[CERN@school](https://cernatschool.web.cern.ch)
CVMFS repository
and viewed the output using locally-installed
image viewing software.
