#What's Next?
With the completion of the
DIRAC Basic Tutorials,
we are by no means at the end of our grid journey.
There are many topics still be covered by the _UserGuide_,
including:

* Advanced job management with DIRAC;
* Advanced data management with DIRAC;
* Using the DIRAC Python API;
* Using Ganga with GridPP DIRAC.

Check back soon for updates on these topics - or better still,
watch the
[_UserGuide_ GitHub repository](https://github.com/gridpp/user-guides)
to be notified of
[Issues](https://github.com/gridpp/user-guides/issues)
and Pull Requests relating to additions or improvements
to the _UserGuide_.

Many thanks for reading so far, and happy gridding!
