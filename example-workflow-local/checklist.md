# An example workflow: local running - checklist

* I can create, configure, and submit a local job that uses
local-sourced data as input and software hosted on CVMFS
using Ganga;
* I can view the output logs from my local job
with the `peek` command;
* I can find and retrieve the output of my local job using
the `outputdir` command in Ganga.
