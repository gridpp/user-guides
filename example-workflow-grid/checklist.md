# Moving the example workflow to the grid - checklist

* I can activate DIRAC by sourcing the DIRAC `bashrc` script from CVMFS;
* I can generate a Grid proxy using the `dirac-proxy-init` command;
* I can submit the CERN@school example workflow job to the Grid using Ganga;
* I can monitor my Grid job(s) using the
[GridPP DIRAC web portal](https://dirac.gridpp.ac.uk).
