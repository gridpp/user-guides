#The DIRAC Basic Tutorials

Now that you have a functioning DIRAC UI
you are in a position to start submitting **grid jobs** and
putting your data on the Grid.
As it happens, DIRAC have provided a number of
[tutorials](https://github.com/DIRACGrid/DIRAC/wiki/DIRAC-Tutorials)
on their GitHub page wiki that cover many aspects of the functionality
you will need.
