#Getting Help
There are many ways of getting help and support
if you run into problems while working through the
_GridPP UserGuide_. 
If you don't happen to have a GridPP expert in the office
down the corridor, you can try the methods described below.

##Googling the error
We can't possibly account for every error a user might
encounter when working through the _UserGuide_,
so on encountering a problem your first port of call
should be sticking the error message into your
Search Engine of Choice.

This is actually a pretty good approach to software development
in general. Thanks to vibrant, enthusastic communities like
those at StackExchange many common computing gotchas have been
documented and solved on the World Wide Web - so it's always worth
checking!

##Issue tracking via GitHub

The easiest way to report problems,
make suggestions,
or submit comments about the _UserGuide_
is by raising
an **issue** on the _GridPP UserGuide_
[GitHub repository](http://github.com/GridPP/user-guides).
Simply log in to GitHub,
visit the _UserGuide_
[issues page](https://github.com/gridpp/user-guides/issues)
and click on the
[New issue](https://github.com/gridpp/user-guides/issues/new)
button.

<table>
<tr>
<td align='center'><i class="fa fa-lightbulb-o" style='font-size:3em'></i></td>
<td>
Provide as much information as you can when raising an issue.
You can also use the MarkDown format to create hyperlinks
and add formatting to your issue.
</td>
</tr>
</table>

We'll then have a public record of the issue
which we can then aim to solve as soon as we can.
It's also possible to link issues to the
[pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/)
that fix them.

<table>
<tr>
<td align='center'><i class="fa fa-lightbulb-o" style='font-size:3em'></i></td>

Don't forget to <strong>Watch</strong> the repository too.
You can do this by going to the
<a href='http://github.com/GridPP/user-guides' target='_blank'>repository</a>,
signing in with your
<a href='https://github.com/' target='_blank'>GitHub account</a>,
and clicking on the <strong>Watch</strong> button at the top-right of the page.
You'll then be kept up-to-date with issues and new versions
as the <em>UserGuide</em> evolves over time.

##Mailing lists
A great way to tap into the expertise represented by the
GridPP Collaboration is to join one of the
mailing lists in the table below.
You'll need a valid email address, but if you've
read the [prerequisites](before-we-begin/prerequisites.html)
you know that already.
