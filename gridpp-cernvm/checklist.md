#Creating a Grid UI with a GridPP CernVM - Checklist

* I have installed some virtualisation software on my local machine
that is compatible with the CernVM images listed
[here](http://cernvm.cern.ch/portal/downloads).
* I have downloaded the corresponding CernVM image to my local machine
from the
[CernVM image download page](http://cernvm.cern.ch/portal/downloads).
* I have created a new guest VM on my local machine using the CernVM image;
* I have registered with the CernVM service
[here](https://cernvm-online.cern.ch/user/register)
(or I am a
[CERN computing account](https://account.cern.ch/account/)
holder);
* I have generated a six-digit PIN to pair my CernVM with the GridPP context via the
[CernVM Marketplace](https://cernvm-online.cern.ch/market/list)
* I have entered the six-digit PIN (preceeded by the hash symbol) into
the login prompt of my newly-booted CernVM;
* I have logged in to my new GridPP CernVM using the `gridpp` user account;
* I have accessed folders from my local machine's hard disk
from my GridPP CernVM.
